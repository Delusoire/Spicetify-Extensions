Practical Spicetify Extensions

Install using marketplace or by downloading either dist/extension-name/prism.js (with auto-updates, online only) or dist/extension-name/app.js (no auto-updates, works offline) and putting them in your Spicetify extensions folder.

Most of these extensions are functionally similar to older work from:
